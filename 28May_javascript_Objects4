Introducing Objects
The given class represents a cuboid (e.g. a rectangular prism) that contains the properties of length, width, and height.
Complete the program to calculate and output the volume of given cuboid to the console.
To calculate the volume of cuboid use length*width*height formula.

//your code goes here
//create volume to store result
